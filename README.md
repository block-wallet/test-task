# BlockWallet Code Challenge

React App with TypeScript template

## Task

Build a **mock app** to send ETH (without interacting with any blockchain or wallet) with the given user interface.

### Key points

- Transactions must be **stored and fetched** making use of the `TransactionsService` `addTransaction()` and `getListOfTransactions()` methods
- Past transactions must be *listed* on the **main page**
- You would need to add an **amount to transfer** input field (note: it's not present in the image, styling should be consistent)
- Styling and layout do not have to be necessarily like the provided image

### Steps

- **Fork** the repo into a public Github repository.
- Add the needed **commits** (preferably following a convention) to fulfill the task.
- Push the code to **Github**.
- Send the **public link** and explanations if needed to our team.
- Wait for our feedback :)

**Note: NO backend is needed, this is an entirely front-end task.**

## What will be evaluated?

- Architecture skills.
- React and frontend skills.
- Clean and consistent interface would be a bonus.
